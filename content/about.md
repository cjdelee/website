The first ever Dungeons & Dragons adventure created and published by TSR was module **G1: Steading of the Hill Giant Chief**. This would be the beginning of how adventures and campaigns were envisioned to be run by the creators of Dungeons & Dragons: Small, "bite-sized" adventures, each taking characters through only a handful of character levels, that would be strung together to create a unique and enriched game experience. Every campaign was different, even if everyone was using the same published adventures. Depending on how you connected these adventures together would change the overall experience and story drastically. \
\
Fast forward to 2014 and 5th Edition, and this modularity has all but evaporated. The first full adventure (excluding the Starter Set) published for 5e was **Hoard of the Dragon Queen**, the first adventure in the Tyranny of Dragons set. This one adventure took characters from level 1 all the way through to level 7. Add on **The Rise of Tiamat** and characters can be expected to reach level 15, a point when a lot of characters are retired. Across just 2 adventures, we have an entire campaign. For reference, the entire Against the Giants set of modules (3 adventures, G1, G2, and G3), were meant to take characters from level 8 to level 12.
# The Goal of Return of the Modular Adventure
This is where this website comes in. To me, the idea of having a large source of smaller, bite-sized adventures that are stitched together to form a more unique whole is FAR more interesting than running effectively the same evil dragon god campaign that everyone else is running. Sure, there can and will be some variation between tables that run Tyranny of Dragons, but only so much. At the end of the day, everyone will be fighting the dragon cults and killing Tiamat at the end. And this has become the standard for Wizards of the Coast and Dungeons & Dragons. Here is a list of some of the 5e adventures with their listed level ranges:
* **Tyranny of Dragons (2 Adventures):** Levels 1-15
* **Out of the Abyss (1 Adventure):** Levels 1-15
* **Curse of Strahd (1 Adventure):** Levels 1-10
* **Waterdeep (2 Adventures):** Levels 1-20
* **Rime of the Frostmaiden (1 Adventure):** Levels 1-12

An entire 5e campaign can be contained in just 2-3 adventures, sometimes 1! \

Now, I should say that **none of this is bad by any means!** Many of the above listed adventures are FANTASTIC and you should definitely consider running them if they interest you! There is also nothing wrong with preferring this style of adventure module setup. The point I am trying to make is that the design philosophy for D&D adventures has changed. It's not better or worse, just different. \
\
Me, personally, I prefer to run a more unique, sandbox-y adventure. I would much rather have 10-20 different, smaller adventures that I can sprinkle throughout a world and set my players lose to discover them all. Not only would this be fun for me, but it would mean that I can use the same world AND the same adventures over and over again since there is no chance or guarantee that the players will play through all of the adventures I have seeded throughout the world. And that is what I am trying to do with this site. \
\
My plan is to create and release adventure modules with the design ideology of classic TSR in mind: bite-sized adventures that can be mixed and matched to create unique and engaging campaigns. I also will be taking my experiences as a GM and writing articles in the hopes to help new GMs learn some of the ropes, and to present some new ways of thinking when it comes to running the game. \
