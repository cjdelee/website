Which of the following examples of play sounds better to you?

**Example 1**

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***GM:*** Searching through the chest, you find 50 gold pieces and a vial of some mysterious liquid.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Rogue:*** I'll take the gold! Just gonna add it to the party funds... Yep, definitely doing that right now.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Wizard:*** What's the vial of liquid? * *rolls for Intelligence* * Ah! I got a 19!
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***GM:*** Well... OK. It's a very potent, magical acid.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Wizard:*** Sweet! Gonna store that away for a rainy day!

**Example 2**

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***GM:*** Searching through the chest, you find 50 gold pieces and a vial of some mysterious liquid.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Rogue:*** I'll take the gold! Just gonna add it to the party funds... Yep, definitely doing that right now.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Wizard:*** What's the vial of liquid?
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***GM:*** You're not sure. You've never seen this stuff before.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Wizard:*** Can I roll something to figure out what it is?
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***GM:*** No need to roll. Tell me, how would * *you* * figure out what it is?
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Wizard:*** Hmm. Well, what does the liquid look like, exactly?
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***GM:*** You hold the vial up to the torchlight and swirl it around. The liquid is a very dark grey, almost black, and appears to be quite viscous, sticking to the sides of the vial.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Wizard:*** OK. I open it up and smell it.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***GM:*** It smells horribly acrid, burning your nose.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Wizard:*** Alright, I think I have a hunch to what this stuff might be. Can I tip over just a drop onto a nearby piece of wood? Maybe the chest we found it in?
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***GM:*** Sure! As the single drop of the liquid hits the chest, it immediately begins to sizzle and smoke. It soon melts a hole clean through the chest and begins to melt into the stone beneath before burning out completely.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Wizard:*** Ah! OK, very dangerous acid. Noted!

If you would prefer to run the game as the first example, then this post is not for you. I'm not saying there is anything objectively incorrect about playing any game following the sequence found in Example 1. We all enjoy the hobby in different ways, and that's great! But this article is going to explore how we might get a bit more creative enjoyment out of the game by relying less on our character sheets and dice and more on our own creativity and imagination.

### Descriptions or Dice? That is the Question
While playing TTRPGs, many, *many* things are seemingly meant to be resolved using dice and numbers on a character sheet. Want to hit the ogre with your sword? Roll for an attack. Trying to scale a sheer cliff? Roll an Athletics check. Bluffing your way past the guards into the palace? Roll a Deception check. These mechanics are designed to give us a way to determine an outcome for any given situation where there is the chance for failure.

That's all well and good, but this can quickly lead players to using their character sheets and the numbers as a crutch. Need to identify the magic potion you just found? Just roll some dice and get an answer.
