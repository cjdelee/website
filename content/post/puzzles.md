Let's set the scene: You have been preparing your next game session *for weeks* now and it is complete. The party is getting ready to dive head first into an evil mage's lair to put a stop to their nefarious plot before it's too late. You've mapped the dungeon, placed the traps and treasure, stocked your wandering monster and encounter tables, and built out just about every single thing you could think of. And, the *piece de resistance*: a beautifully devious and challenging puzzle to mess with your players' brains. It is the PERFECT set piece for your big bad.

Fast forward to game night, and everything falls apart. Why? The entire 4 hour session is spent with the players banging their heads against a wall ceaslessly trying to piece together your masterful puzzle. They can't figure it out, so they're mad, and you think that the puzzle should have been solved **hours** ago, so now you're mad too! At the end of the night, everyone goes home unsatisfied. Try again next week, I suppose?

## Why Do We *Want* Puzzles?
Every single GM at some point in their career has thought to themselves: "Ooooh, this would be the *perfect* time to include a nice, fun puzzle!". And that's perfectly valid! I've had the same thoughts and desires in the past. We want to challenge our players in a new way. Sure, we can throw some monsters or a trap at them, but those are simply tools to deplete resources before the big encounter at the end of the adventure. A puzzle, on the other hand, gives us the chance to challenge our players *minds* instead of their character sheets.

I feel it is also more often than not that the situation outline above happens: we think of a great puzzle that's not *too* challenging, but just challenging enough to be satisfying, and the players *still* can't figure it out to save their lives. 

## Do You *Need* Puzzles?
The short answer is no. You don't *need* to include puzzles in your dungeons to have a fulfilling game experience. You could run an entire multi-year campaign without a single puzzle and it could still be the best game you've ever run. As with almost every aspect of this hobby, it's up to you and your players what bits and pieces you use. If puzzles don't fit the game you are running, don't use 'em! A good way to know if puzzles will work with your campaign is to get some **player buy-in**.

### Player Buy-In
This is something that should be brought up during a session 0 (check out my thoughts on session 0's [here](/post/session-0)!) When discussing the campaign you are wanting to run, you should bring up puzzles. Ask your players what their thoughts are, if they would even like puzzles, how often to include puzzles, and how challenging they should be. If you have a group of players that want a lot of *really* challenging puzzles thrown their way, **AND** you're happy with running that kind of game, then that is something you should know before you start working on the bulk of the campaign.

## How to Make Puzzles Work
Alright, so you've decided that you do want puzzles in your game. That's great! We're going to go through how I think puzzles can be added to a game effectively. As we already determined, puzzles need to be easy enough that the players aren't banging their heads against the wall trying to figure it out, but challenging enough to be satisfying. Again, you will want to first make sure your players will get some enjoyment out of solving puzzles before you start littering your campaign with them.

### Start at the End
Once you've established that your players actually *want* puzzles, we can actually start building one. The best advice I can give here is to start at the end. What is the solution, the end result? Where do you want your players *to end up* after solving the puzzle? The solution to the puzzle is the most important piece. Once the puzzle is solved, what's going to happen? Is a secret passage going to open up? Or will the players learn some new, important information that will help them later? Does solving the puzzle open an interdimensional gate, set free an evil necromancer's prisoner, or does it simply open the way to a treasure horde?

Knowing where you're players will end up will help to inform you on how they get there. It can also become a great source of inspiration. Knowing what the puzzle is protecting can inform on how someone would have built the puzzle in the first place.

### Build Your Pieces (with an Asterisk)
Once you know where you are going, you can start to figure out how your players will get there. This is what most people think of when imagining designing a puzzle for their players. It's also the most fun part! This is where you can get *really* creative with your puzzles. What buttons need to be pressed to make the thing do the other thing? That's what we get to create!

If you're anything like me as a GM, one of your first worries will be "How can I make this puzzle realistic?" In reality, you can't. The real world doesn't really operate on Indiana Jones rules when it comes to puzzles. But that's OK, because we don't need to worry about *realism*. All we need to worry about is *verisimilitude* ([Realism vs. Verisimilitude](/post/realism-verisimilitude)). Our puzzle doesn't need to be realistic, just believable. If our players *believe* that this puzzle *could* exist in this world, then we've succeeded.
