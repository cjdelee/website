## Introduction for Players
The city of Caerwyn is the bustling, river-side capitol of the Magocracy of Alnor: the perfect place for a party of newly-anointed adventurers to prove their worth. Your party has been contracted by a powerful mage-priest: Lady Silra the Copper-Handed. The Lady Silra, known for her propensity of sponsoring new and brave adventurers, has asked you all to prove that you are worthy of her generosity by seeking out an associate of hers that has gone missing: Sir Aleks Drake. \
 \
According to Lady Silra, Drake was sent to investigate rumors of illegal smuggling activity taking place somewhere in the sewers on the north edge of town. He left 3 days prior, and has not been seen since. It is up to you to descend into the sewers, find Drake, and put an end to any smuggling activity that may be taking place there.

## Information for GMs
This adventure is designed to be a small, introductory adventure for new players and GMs alike. If you are not used to a sandbox style of game play or using a modular approach when it comes to adventure modules, then this is the perfect place to start. \
\
This adventure will take you and your players through the sewers of Caerwyn, a vast network of corridors and passageways filled with all manner of creatures. This particular adventure will see your players through some maintenance tunnels, into a secret abandoned wizard's laboratory, and into the den of the smugglers who have taken up residence in the north sewers of Caerwyn. This is a great adventure for low-level characters (levels 1-3). This can be used as just a one-shot, or it can be the introductory adventure in a whole new campaign set in the Magocracy of Alnor.
