## Introduction for Players
The Festival of Stars is nigh! Once every 41 years, people all across the Magocracy of Alnor celebrate the turn of the skies, holding festivals and celebrations in every corner of the kingdom. The celebration marks the Signing, a time when the next Wizard-Heir may be found. A child born under the Sign, a constellation that appears in the sky only during the Festival, is destined to be the next ruler of the Magocracy. \
\
The village of Belder's Post is set to make their festival one of particular remembrance. Ellena and Deidrich Whistlewind, simple farmers, are expecting a child very soon, and many residents of Belder's Post suspect it to be born during the Festival and named Wizard-Heir. But rarely do these things ever go to plan... \
\
When a mysterious magic-user makes an appearance at the Festival in Belder's Post, claiming to bring entertainment for the festivities, the entire village (you adventurers included!) is whisked away across space and time to another realm. A world of deep red, scarred earth, strange plants and creatures, and alien horrors awaits you and the villagers of Belder's Post. It's up to you to find the magic-user (who has mysteriously gone missing) and get everyone home safely

## Information for GMs
This adventure is a fun and strange introduction to hexcrawling and wilderness adventure. If you've never really dived into this style of play, this is a great first place to start. This module will provide you with information and tools on how to run a hexcrawl, and even a few tips on creating your own! \
\
Being a hexcrawl, this module is a bit larger than some of the other module adventures you will find here, but it will still be small enough that you can mix it in with other modules to build out a full campaign. Or, you can expand on the Alien World and run a full campaign there! This will take some more work on your part, but the tools provided in this module should help at least with expanding the hexcrawl portion of the campaign. If you feel like stretching your campaign design muscles and aren't afraid of doing some work, you should definitely try this out.
